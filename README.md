Token Contract (ERC20-like)
This Solidity contract defines a basic ERC20-like token with minting and burning capabilities.

Contract Details
Token Name: MINTERS
Token Abbreviation: MTR
Initial Total Supply: 0
Features
Minting: Allows creating new tokens and assigning them to addresses.
Burning: Allows destroying tokens held by addresses, provided they have sufficient balance.

Considerations:
This contract is designed for Solidity compiler version ^0.8.18.
Ensure proper security measures are implemented before deploying to a production environment (e.g., overflow protection, access control).
This contract lacks standard ERC20 functions like transfer, approve, and transferFrom, which are crucial for full ERC20 compliance and interoperability with wallets and exchanges.
